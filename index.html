    <h2><em>My background</em></h2>
    <p id="intro-para">
      My name is Maya. I have created this website for my Computer Science module (COMP1021). </br> It aims to encourage women to pursue Computer Science as a career path and help reduce the gender gap in computer science. </br> This website was important to me to create, having been the only female in my A-Level Computer Science class, which as a result dettered me from continuing to pursue the subject at University, </br> with the fear of again being one of the only females and having to study in an uncomfortable environment again. As a result, I am studying economics. </br> However I have realised that we shouldn't be influenced by our surroundings, and should pursue what we enjoy. </br> Lets get more females into Computer Science, and prove that <em> Girls can code</em>
