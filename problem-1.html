    <h1> The problem of "Pinkifying" </h1>
    <img src="pinkproblem.jpg" alt="4 photos of pink websites"/>
    <p> It's 2019, and the current way encouraging females to consider to learn programming, to learn to code and to consider tech careers, is through <code> pinkifying </code> </p>
    <h2> 1. What is it? </h2>
    <p> "In a nutshell, this means creating fonts that are more, you know, pink. Flowery. Girly. Make websites pink or purple. Print documents on pink and purple polka-dot paper."
    <a href=https://code.likeagirl.io/no-need-to-pinkify-c5609faf6f7f > (Reference: Trask, 2017) </a> Clearly this is unnecessary. <br>We shoud be encouraging females to pursue these fields because they're interested in them and not by using the gender normative colours of 'pinks' and 'purples', which further reinforce the gender sterotypes which today's society is investing to hard to break down
    <a href=https://code.likeagirl.io/is-pinkifying-a-good-strategy-to-get-girls-into-coding-45cd2f3f619b/>More information on this concept can be read here</a>
    <h2> Stop, is "pinkifying" necessarily a bad thing? </h2>
    <p> "The idea of pinkifying isn't necessarily a negative" (Mansee Muzumdar, 2016, cited by Dupere, 2016). The intentions are pure, and to an extent; successful. However it's a band-aid solution. The fix is real engagement, on the potential and possibilities that coding can acheive.
